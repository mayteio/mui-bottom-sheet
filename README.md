# `mui-bottom-sheet`

> ðŸ‘† A delightful bottom sheet component for react up to material design spec

The bottom sheet in the Google Maps app for a location is _really_ nice. I set out to recreate that level of UX detail with a modern `BottomSheet` for React. [Try it in the storybook](https://mayteio.github.io/mui-bottom-sheet/).

![Bottom Sheet Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43975092/78733881-0f751300-798a-11ea-8c9c-62cda96fc35b.gif)

Under the hood it uses `react-spring` for delightful animations and `react-use-gesture` to handle dragging. This is still a work in progress - let me know features you'd like and I'll add them in.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add mui-bottom-sheet
```

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import { BottomSheet } from 'mui-bottom-sheet';

export const App = () => {
  return <BottomSheet>Add your content here</BottomSheet>;
};
```

| prop            | type                                         | description                                                                                                                                                            | default                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `backdrop`      | `boolean?`                                   | Whether to show the transparent backdrop that fades in as you pull up.                                                                                                 | `true`                                       |
| `background`    | `React.ReactElement?`                        | Background element that slides up behind the main bottom sheet.                                                                                                        | `null`                                       |
| `currentIndex`  | `number?`                                    | Pass in an index to control which stop height the sheet is at. Number should be in range of total stops: `[defaultHeight, ...peekHeights, fullHeight?]`.               | `undefined`                                  |
| `defaultHeight` | `number?`                                    | Default height when the sheet is closed.                                                                                                                               | `100`                                        |
| `hidden`        | `boolean?`                                   | When true, the sheet will completely hide at the bottom of the screen.                                                                                                 | `false`                                      |
| `fullHeight`    | `boolean?`                                   | Whether to allow the sheet to go 100% of the screen height. If false, the highest it can go is the maximum of `peekHeights`. Otherwise it'll stick to `defaultHeight`. | `true`                                       |
| `onIndexChange` | `(index:number) => void?`                    | This will be fired when the user interacts with the sheet and moves it to a position other than the current one.                                                       | `undefined`                                  |
| `peekHeights`   | `number[]?`                                  | Progressive peek heights for the bottom sheet to stop at. Use this to reveal more detailed information as the sheet is pulled up.                                      | `[]`                                         |
| `springConfig`  | `Record<string, any>?`                       | The [`react-spring` config](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/api#configs) used when snapping to heights.                                                         | `config.stiff`                               |
| `styles`        | `{ root: {}, backdrop: {}, background: {} }` | Pass additional styles to either the sheet, the backdrop or the background components.                                                                                 | `{ root: {}, backdrop: {}, background: {} }` |
| `threshold`     | `number?`                                    | The threshold for over-dragging the sheet above its maximum height before it snaps to the highest position.                                                            | `70`                                         |

## Upcoming

- [ ] Cypress tests - Jest doesn't play nicely with dragging and dropping. Help appreciated.
- [ ] Hooks API for binding custom components instead of a prescribed `animated.div`
- [x] ~~Programatically set stop height~~ see `currentIndex` and `onIndexChange`
- [x] ~~Access to current stop index~~
- [x] ~~`open()` and `close()` for programatic interaction~~
- [ ] passing custom `react-spring` config
- [ ] anything else?
